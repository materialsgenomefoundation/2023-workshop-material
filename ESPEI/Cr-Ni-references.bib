@article{karmazin1982lattice,
abstract = {In this paper, more accurate phase limits of the NiCr phase diagram for the alloy composition near to Ni2Cr are presented and new information about the phase transformations of NiCr alloys is given. The phase boundary of the terminal nickel-rich solid solution was determined for temperatures from 550 to 1000 °C. Two different limiting curves related to the Ni2Cr superstructure were found. The limit below which this superstructure forms is placed 37 °C below the limit above which it decomposes. The existence of two structure morphologies of the Ni2Cr superstructure is indicated. The phase transformations of the nickel-rich solid solution in the region examined are markedly strain dependent. After quenching from high temperatures and heating at temperatures below about 500 °C has taken place, a supersaturated metastable solid solution exists in which the Ni2Cr superstructure forms. In the deformed material the precipitation of the chromium-rich phase precedes or accompanies the formation of the Ni2Cr superstructure. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

abstract = {Composition profiles of eight Cr-X (X = Co, Fe, Mo, Nb, Ni, Pd, Pt, Ta) binary systems are collected from diffusion multiples from which composition-dependent interdiffusion coefficients for all the phases in these eight binary systems are extracted using a forward-simulation method. Very strong composition dependency of the interdiffusion coefficients is observed in the Cr-rich bcc phase of the Cr-Co, Cr-Fe, Cr-Ni and Cr-Pt systems. Impurity diffusion coefficients are also extracted using the forward-simulation method and are compared with data reported in the literature. The good agreement between data obtained from the current study and those reported in the literature serves as a validation of the forward-simulation method in extracting both interdiffusion and impurity diffusion coefficients. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.
